          After 7 years as a technology-forward educator, I wanted to learn more
          about the software that I had been using in my classroom; this is
          where my journey to becoming a self-taught programmer began. Now, I am
          a Software Developer that is equipped with all of the soft skills that
          are sharpened by a teaching career, and has the capacity to never stop
          learning. I am seeking new opportunities that will allow me to explore
          new, modern technologies, continue to grow as a software development
          professional, and contribute to innovative and dynamic projects.
